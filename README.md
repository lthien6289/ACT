***Android and iOS App for Full Length ACT MATH Exams.***
We are building mobile versions for Full Length ACT MATH tests with the LT6280’s ACT app for Apple and Android devices. We hope that these apps can help you easier to practice and prepare for ACT exams. Students can study a specific course to get prepared for the ACT Exam. When students take a full-length test in these apps, they can accurately assess their knowledge level. Whether students’re studying math, science, English, or art, the apps will get they the right math study tools at the tap of a finger. The learning experience is different for every student. However, we believe that when students take a full-length ACT MATH test, they can navigate how to succeed in this part of the test. With this app, students can have on their phones many individual math subjects and they will see these subjects on their ACT standardized tests. Many mathematical topics like Algebra, Advanced Geometry, Trigonometry, Modeling, Statistics, or Probability; these apps have students covered. These apps can help students to feel confident in their math skills and ready for ACT exams.
